Sheep are smarter than we normally think they are. They’re also often docile and can easily be trained.

    <em><h3>The Pros and Cons of Keeping Sheep as Pets</h3></em>
    <p>While sheep need to be with their own kind, their gentle natures can make them wonderful for humans to be around. A lamb that is raised on a bottle can bond especially well with a human. This is because they are encouraged to think of the human feeding them as a maternal figure.Let’s take a look at some of the pros and cons of having sheep as pets:</p>
    <ul>
        <em><li>
            Sheep tend to be calm and affectionate (as long as you stick with female or neutered male sheep).
You may be surprised to learn it’s easy to train sheep.
If you have kids, sheep can make a wonderful family pet.
Sheep can help the quality of your lawns. They produce excellent fertilizer.

        </li></em>
        <em><li>
            You will need to have more than one sheep since they are herd animals.
If you have wooled sheep, you will have to shear them once a year. You will need to buy the equipment to do this.
You will need extensive knowledge on how to properly feed and take care of your sheep.
Sheep require a large amount of outdoor space so that they can graze and get the exercise they need.
        </li></em>
        <em><li>
            You’ll also need to build fencing to contain the outside area where your sheep will graze. This is essential to keep your sheep safe from potential predators, and even from other animals like dogs. This can be incredibly expensive to put the necessary fencing in place.There may be zoning regulations or other restrictions in your area that prohibit you from having livestock (like sheep) on your property. You will have to trim your sheep’s hooves (or pay for a professional to trim them) regularly. This task requires special equipment, so this is another expense.
        </li></em>
        <em><li>
            There may be problems if you also have dogs. This is because all dogs (with the exception of dogs specifically bred to protect sheep) have a predatory instinct and they may alarm or even hurt your sheep. Even if a dog does not harass the sheep, its presence may still worry and stress the sheep, adversely affecting their health and well-being.
