    <h2>What makes an animal a pet?</h2>
    <p>This time we explain what a pet is by covering three parts of the definition and why understanding which animals are pets is vital to animal welfare.</p>
    <p>A pet is a companion animal which is an animal that lives with you in your home like a dog or cat. Companion animals are a result of domestication.</p> <p>They live with us because they fulfill our needs as well. They can provide us comfort, friendship and responsibility.</p>

    <h3>Domestic Animals</h3>
    <p>A domestic animal is an animal that has been tamed by humans for the purpose of living with them. A pet must be a domestic animal. Pet dogs were domesticated from Gray Wolves and pet cats were domesticated from a species of wildcat from ancient Egypt. Domestication is a process where humans select animals for specific traits and temperaments and continue to breed these animals until there is a population of animals with those desired characteristics. Over time, the animals become tamer and more successful companions to humans. Pet cats and dogs are a result of humans choosing what they like about an animal repeatedly over thousands of years. On the other hand, a wild animal is not adapted to live with humans because they were not domesticated by humans.</p>
