    <h2>What makes an animal a pet?</h2>
    <p>This time we explain what a pet is by covering three parts of the definition and why understanding which animals are pets is vital to animal welfare.A pet is a companion animal which is an animal that lives with you in your home like a dog or cat. Companion animals are a result of domestication.They live with us because they fulfill our needs as well. They can provide us comfort, friendship and responsibility.</p>

    <em><h3>Domestic Animals</h3></em>
    <p>A domestic animal is an animal that has been tamed by humans for the purpose of living with them. A pet must be a domestic animal. Pet dogs were domesticated from Gray Wolves and pet cats were domesticated from a species of wildcat from ancient Egypt. Domestication is a process where humans select animals for specific traits and temperaments and continue to breed these animals until there is a population of animals with those desired characteristics. Over time, the animals become tamer and more successful companions to humans. Pet cats and dogs are a result of humans choosing what they like about an animal repeatedly over thousands of years. On the other hand, a wild animal is not adapted to live with humans because they were not domesticated by humans.</p>

    <em><h3>Animal Needs</h3></em>
    <p>An animal that depends on you for all of their basic needs is a pet. Food, water, shelter, oxygen, space, safety, family, and respect are all basic needs that require human intervention to be taken care of. In animals that are not pets, they do not need humans to take care of them.</p>
