    <h2>What makes <em>CAT</em> a GOOD pet?</h2>
    <p>Research has shown that cats can provide emotional support, improve moods, and contribute to the overall morale of their owners. Cats are also credited with promoting socialization among older individuals and physically or mentally disabled people. Nearly 40 million households in the United States have pet cats.Although cats are great companions, cat owners should be aware that sometimes cats can carry harmful germs that can cause a variety of illnesses in people, ranging from minor skin infections to serious illnesses.</p>

    <em><h3>How to stay healthy around pet cats</h3></em>
    <p>Certain types of cat or kitten adoptions, like international pet adoption, may not be suitable for your family because of the risk for disease. This is particularly true if young children, pregnant women, or people with weakened immune systems live in the household.Research and learn how to properly care for your cat or kitten before purchase. Ask your veterinarian or pet store staff about the proper food, care, and enclosure or environment that is best for the cat or kitten you are selecting.</p>
    <em><h3>How to choose a cat</h3></em>
    <p>Match a cat’s personality and activity levels with your family, the animals you already have in your household, and the amount of time you have to spend with your pet.Pick a cat that is bright, alert, and playful. Cats and kittens should have shiny, soft fur that is free of poop and debris.Signs of sickness in a cat include appearing sluggish or depressed, having diarrhea, abnormal breathing, and fluid running from its eyes or nose.</p>
    <em><h3>Animal Needs</h3></em>
    <p>An animal that depends on you for all of their basic needs is a pet. Food, water, shelter, oxygen, space, safety, family, and respect are all basic needs that require human intervention to be taken care of. In animals that are not pets, they do not need humans to take care of them.</p>

    <em><h3>Owning A Non-Pet</h3></em>
    <p>Being able to distinguish which animals are considered pets and which are not is very essential. Owning an animal that is not domesticated, is not a companion animal and does not depend on humans for their needs can result in undesirable situations. Some examples of what can go wrong include:</p>
    <ul>
        <em><li>
            Hurting the animal’s quality of life. These animals do not depend on humans for their needs, so by holding them captive there is no direct benefit to the animal. Often, just the amount of space animals need that are not pets is larger than what most people can accommodate for. A human environment can be vastly different to the environment the animal is accustomed to and not be sufficient. By keeping these animals as pets, you could actually be preventing this animal from fulfilling its needs.
        </li></em>
        <em><li>
            Risking injury to yourself. In animals that were not tamed, or bred for preferred behavior, how they respond to interacting with humans can be unpredictable and dangerous. The unavoidable lack of social understanding between humans and other animals can lead to natural defensive behavior that results in the owner’s injury or death.
        </li></em>
        <em><li>
            Risking injury to others. All animals have the ability, if not the desire, to escape and explore a greater area. While this is unsafe for pet cats and dogs, it can be even worse for another animal. A wild animal roaming in an unfamiliar environment could result in the harm or death of another animal, including a human. The outcome of an escape ultimately depends on the nature of the individual animal, but in order to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all animals we should make decisions that do not increase this chance.
        </li></em>
        <em><li>
            Risking injury to the animal. If the animal resides in an improper space or does not receive other necessary care, like a specialized diet, it could hurt or kill the animal. Additionally, in the case that the animal escapes your home, it could be injured or killed by another animal as well, again including a human.
        </li></em>
    </ul>
